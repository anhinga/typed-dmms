# Typed dataflow matrix machines 

Typed DMMs are capable of using various kinds of linear streams within one DMM.

Typed DMMs were first introduced in _"Dataflow matrix machines as programmable, dynamically expandable, self-referential generalized recurrent neural networks"_:

There were several untyped implementations in 2015-2018 including our current reference implementation:

First drafts of a typed implementation were written in 2019:
