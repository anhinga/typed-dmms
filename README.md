# Typed dataflow matrix machines using various kinds of linear streams

Typed DMMs were first introduced in "Dataflow matrix machines as programmable, dynamically expandable, self-referential generalized recurrent neural networks":

https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05296

There were several untyped implementations including our current reference implementation:

First drafts of a typed implementation were written in 2019:
